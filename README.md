# Digital Dead Drop Simulation

A web-based educational simulation built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to demonstrate **asynchronous and indirect message exchange**. The project models a **digital dead drop** concept used in cyber security, with one-time message retrieval and no direct sender–receiver interaction.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Sender can drop a message via `sender.html`.  
3. Check message at `location.html`.  
4. Receiver collects message via `receiver.html`.
