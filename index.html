<h2>What is a Digital Dead Drop?</h2>
<p>
A digital dead drop is a method of indirect communication where one person
leaves information at a location and another person collects it later
without direct contact.

<h2>Purpose of This Project</h2>
<p>
This project is an educational simulator created to explain how attackers
and defenders understand covert communication.
